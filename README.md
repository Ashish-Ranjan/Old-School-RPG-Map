Introduction
------------

This is a demo of an old school console style JRPG, perhaps like Dragon Warrior
or Final Fantasy for the original NES. It is written in 100% HTML5, CSS, and
JavaScript, with no server side processing or client side plugins. A modern
HTML5 capable browser is required to run the game.
